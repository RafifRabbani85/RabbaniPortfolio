# Portfolio Project Guide

This guide will help you understand the current state of your portfolio project and fix any missing images.

## Current Status

Your portfolio now displays all projects correctly! Here's what's working:

✅ All categories (UI/UX DESIGN, WEB DEVELOPMENT, GRAPHIC DESIGN) are displaying  
✅ Project information (titles, descriptions, tags) is showing correctly  
✅ Colorful placeholder images appear for any missing image files  
✅ Available images are displaying properly  

## Missing Images

Some image files referenced in your `Projects.txt` are missing from your project:

1. **UI/UX Design (UTShirt)**: All images exist ✅
2. **Web Development (Rexus Sport Center)**: All images exist ✅
3. **Web Development (Markass Sport Center)**: Only 1 of 4 images exists (markass4.png) ⚠️
4. **Web Development (AgroVerse)**: No images exist ❌

## How to Add the Missing Images

1. **Option 1: Add the actual image files**
   - Place your image files in: `/public/images/projects/`
   - Make sure filenames match exactly what's in Projects.txt
   - Required format: PNG files

2. **Option 2: Keep using placeholder images**
   - The colorful placeholder images look good and your portfolio is fully functional
   - No further action needed

3. **Option 3: Update Projects.txt**
   - Edit Projects.txt to only list image files you actually have

## Tools Included

I've created a helpful page to check image status:

- **Image Checker**: Open `/utility.html` in your browser
- This tool shows which images are missing and which are available
- Color-coded indicators make it easy to see what needs attention

## Portfolio Format

Your portfolio now correctly uses this format in Projects.txt:

```
=== CATEGORY NAME ===

--- Project 1 ---
TITLE: Project Title
DESC: Project description text
IMAGES: 
- image1.png
- image2.png
TAGS: Tag1, Tag2, Tag3
LINK: https://project-link.com
GITHUB: https://github.com/link

--- Project 2 ---

```
